TODO:
x Everything works with foo -> bar.
x Now make it work with the proper transform (at a simple scale).
- make it work with a single var
-- unroll the single var
-- replace each part with the import (where appropriate)'
-- ignore commented out code?
-- keep track of it properly...
- test it against a real file (and see how that would go)
- add other things into the file to ensure they are preserved...
- push up into repo when that works...

- Get all the es5-6 transforms working with tests with jscodeshift.




LATER:
- write a blog post
- es5-6 editor that does the transforms for you... (Like opposite of Babel). Can Babel do that now?
- Try using Tape instead of mocha...

TALK: easing into es6/2015
